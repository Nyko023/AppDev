*Izuku Midoriya is a boy who wishes to become a hero just like his idol, All Might, however lacking a Quirk makes the dream feel impossible, and makes him an easy target for bullying, like from his childhood friend, Katsuki Bakugo. However, after an incident where Izuku meets All Might, he proves himself worthy of becoming a hero, and is chosen as All Might's successor to inherit his Quirk, One For All, which allows him to get accepted to U.A. High School, and learn how to become a true hero.*
